<p>Social media channels provide a vast amount of data on your target audience interests and preferences. How to analyze it?</p>



<p>Many companies that have already invested a lot of time and money in marketing campaigns are looking for the measurable ways of analyzing their efforts. Broad analysis can be done with the use of predictive analytics techniques such as text mining and opinion mining.</p>



<h3>What is the sentiment/ opinion mining </h3>



<p>In the short text, mining is all about deriving high- quality information from the text. At first, the program structures the input text, then derives patterns within the structured data in order to evaluate and interpret the output. Sentiment Mining also referred to Sentiment Analysis which is part of the text mining, is about extracting the opinions or sentiments given in a piece of text using IR, AI and NLP techniques. This provides a great source of unstructured information (especially opinions) that may be useful to others.</p>



<p>How can sentiment and text mining tools help your company to grow?</p>



<h3>Planning your marketing and social media campaign</h3>



<p>Getting information about what your clients like, what they tend to follow in a fast and concise way will help you to adjust marketing strategies and plan your social media campaign accordingly. Early-adopter organizations in industries such as consumer goods, healthcare/pharmaceutical, retail, hospitality, and government are already successfully leveraging the practice to get closer to their customers-and add distance between themselves and their competition.</p>



<h3>Text mining enables you to be more efficient</h3>



<p>With no doubts you can make the analysing process faster. Saving time means also saving money. With the text mining tools you can analyze thousands of texts. It simply shortens the time required to analyze the corpus to identify sources relevant for the particular problem.</p>



<h3>Search Engine Optimization</h3>



<p>By tracking the most frequent words in your website, text mining can help you with search engine optimization. With this, the tool called extraction can help. It enables to extract keywords from the text which identifies the nature of the text.</p>



<h3>Predicting other people’s decisions</h3>



<p>Given the data, the text mining program can help you to predict how the customers are likely to behave. Text mining can help to answer the question about what customers are likely to choose and how far can predict their choices.</p>



<h3>Tracking opinions over time</h3>



<p>Opinions can be extracted with a time stamp and/or location. We can then analyze changes to opinions about the same event over time, and other statistics. The impact of an entity or event on the overall sentiment about an entity or another event, over the course of time can be also measured.</p>



<p>What do you think? Are text mining tools a useful tool for content and social media marketers?</p>

<p><strong>You have already tried to write your perfect copy but your content doesn’t drive traffic.&nbsp;How to structure your text to catch readers attention? Here are a few writing tips on the text structure used by writing professionals – journalists.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h3>I. Title</h3>



<p>Should be catchy. It must attract the reader’s attention. &nbsp;You can use for that an alliteration or a wordplay. Title needs to be concise, short and contain the message, the main point that we want to get across.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>II. Lead</h3>



<p>Most of the news articles contain lead which follows the title. Lead is a kind of a summary which gives the overall idea of the text. Similarly to title it needs to catch the reader’s attention. It must be short, precise and informative. Blog texts rarely contain lead, and writing it is not necessary. Personally, I prefer texts with leads, because only then I get an idea whether the text is worth reading or not.</p>



<h3>III. The main body</h3>



<h4><strong>1. Beginning, Kick-in</strong></h4>



<p>Sometimes good stories need a good start and here is where the so called “kick in” comes into play. It is usually an introductory paragraph, a picture which provides the background to your story. It might be a situation, a person an interesting event. This point is not a must but it raises the reader’s interest and is the the perfect beginning. The kick-in can start from a generalization, anecdote, metaphor, rhetorical question, a story, situation, joke or sarcasm.</p>



<h4><strong>2.  Billboard</strong></h4>



<p>In billboard we are informing the reader why the text needs to be read, what is that interesting thing that we want to say. Here one can refer to the future as well as the most recent facts. An essential part of billboard might be a piece of new information or (news).</p>



<h5>&nbsp;<strong>b) Thesis statement/ hypothesis</strong></h5>



<p>Thesis statement is your opinion on the given topic. Usually it is stated at the end of the billboard. However, one can put it in the “kick-in” . Good thesis describes the situation, process, problem which we observe and shouldn’t be longer than one or two sentences.</p>



<h4><strong>3. Arguments&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Arguments are the facts which are essential for supporting the thesis and need to be proven by evidence. Here one can put quotes, statistics, data that strictly refer to a thesis.</p>



<h3><strong>IV. Summation or the Kick out</strong></h3>



<p>Kick-out is the end of the article. A good kick-out leaves the reader with some doubt and makes him reflect on the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>—————————————————————————————————————————————————————–</p>



<p>You are probably now asking yourself “Why do I actually need all this? I am not a journalist and I will never be”.</p>



<p>It is true that writing a news article is not exactly the same as writing a blog post. The latter is more informal in style and doesn’t seem to follow any strict rules.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have noticed that many bloggers, companies give their opinions without supporting their view with arguments. Why should your reader’s trust you? Is it just because you are an influencer in your niche with thousands of followers and satisfied clients? Or do you want to show that you create even more value providing evidence for your opinions?</p>



<p>Even the best content will get lost in the sea of information if it is not structured properly.&nbsp;Sometimes bloggers have a lot of interesting things to say but don’t know how to get their point across. Good writing is always at the value and is a craft that&nbsp;can be learnt by anyone. What do you think? Can the rules of news writing be useful for bloggers and content marketers?&nbsp;</p>
